title: Controlling 4k video in vlc with unity3d!
---

For a project that I am working on, I wanted to control the playback of a 4k video entirely from unity. But of course that was not going to happen. After looking at a lot of assets in the asset store that claimed to do this. I finally thought of doing something different entirely.

My requirement: 
				Primary requirement: Play a 4k video with unity.
				Secondary requirement: Control the media player, playing the video.

What I did:
